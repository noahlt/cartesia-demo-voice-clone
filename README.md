# Cartesia voice clone demo

This repo is a demo of how to clone a voice using the Cartesia API.

It's built with Vite, React, and TypeScript, and uses the Cartesia JS SDK.

To run it, you need to set the `VITE_CARTESIA_API_KEY` environment variable in `.env.local` to your Cartesia API key.

You can get a free API key from the Cartesia dashboard.
